                    <p>
                        Welcome to my site! I made this website as a way to merge my two passions: engineering and web development. 
                        As I was searching for a project that I could be motivated about I realized that I could make a website that
                        I would have found useful while still in college. In todays world it can be overwhelming trying to find learning
                        resources. I plan on sharing what resources I found useful in college and others that I discovered during my 
                        professional day to day.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enjoy the site!

                <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is David and i'm currently a structural engineer (EIT).
                        I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charotte with a B.S. in Civil Engineering.
                         I'll be attending NC State University Spring 2022 to persue a Masters Degree in Civil Engineering.
                         Web development has always been an interest for me and this year (2020) I decided to give it a realized
                         chance. As learn more development tools and languages I hope to expand what this site can do.
